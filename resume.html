    <p>As a designer with an analytical mind and a love for the whimsical, I plan to rationale my way through outrageous concepts. Just like my music taste, my art style changes with the seasons. I am determined to curate both the perfect playlist and colour palette for every project thrown my way.</p>
    
   
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    
    <p>What looked like a small patch of purple grass, above five feet square, was moving across the sand in their direction.</p>
    
    <p>When it came near enough he perceived that it was not grass; there were no blades, but only purple roots. The roots were revolving, for each small plant in the whole patch, like the spokes of a rimless wheel.</p>
